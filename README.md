# Bean Classification Using MobileNet model

## Introduction

This is a classification task where dataset is taken from kaggle. This dataset consists of three target groups - Bean Rust, Angular Leaf Spot and Healthy Saplings. The aim is to correctly classify
all the images into their respectively groups.

## Dependencies

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

If you dont have Python installed in your PC ,it can be installed from here [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Hit the command in CMD/Terminal if you don't have it already installed:

    pip install opencv-python

   (OR)
   
 Install OpenCV via anaconda
  
    conda install -c menpo opencv
    
 ## How to Run
 * Run all the cells in the classification notebook and make sure to store the model in your google drive preferably.
 * To deploy the model in streamlit, you need to create a free account using ngrok and get your unique access pin to create a tunnel.
 * You can hit only 4 tunnels at a time in the free tier.
 * If you have no errors, you can click on the link generated in the output cell and see the results
